Created this API with PowerShell v5
because everyone could use an Ajay Safe Space

In honor of the SVTX StartUpBus 2018's
conductor: Ajay Desai 

Provides indicators of compromise
for windows hosts if you're likely
to be "hacked" based on suspicious
use cases. Outputs to JSON. 
Quick and dirty, no warranties.

Disclaimer: The basic use cases are just that
make sure to layer this with other solutions

Provide a computer name or IP address
Requires end host to have WinRM enabled
You can do it with WMI or CIM but I'm lazy.
Or just insert this into a local script.

Also note: This only finds low hanging
fruit in user space portion of the OS.

Usage: 
Import-Module Get-WinCompromiseStatus.psm1
Get-WinCompromiseStatus -host "hostname.local"
